The tallest structure in Ubersreik, it has a commanding view of the surrounding countryside and dominates the town\u2019s skyline. Access to the tower is gained through a complex series of Dwarf engineered levators, powered by cunning use of counterweights and levers. The Tower is the only military position not controlled by the Altdorf State Army, and is instead manned by local soldiers who have disavowed the Jungfreuds.</p> <p>Captain [[Erwin Blucher]] commands the troops stationed here.
