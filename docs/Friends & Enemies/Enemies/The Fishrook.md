Over one hundred years ago, before Grom the Paunch’s horde of Greenskins slaughtered everything in its path, the Vorbergland was one of the most prosperous regions of the Empire. The wide swathe of fertile land between the foothills of the Grey Mountains and the tall bowers of the Reikwald forest was tightly packed with bountiful farms and prosperous towns. Their wealth swiftly grew, making the region one of the richest in the Empire, and the local noble Houses, including the Falkenhayns, Jungfreuds, Saponatheims, and the Drakenburgs, rose to significant prominence.

It was in that era of affluence that a famous highwayman, known only as ‘the Fishrook’, terrorised the Bögenhafen–Ubersreik road. He wore a mask designed after a local bird, the Fishrook, and, if the legend is to be believed, stole as many hearts as he did jewels.

The Fishrook Dalliance was published 50 years ago. It tells a romanticised account of the Fishrook, his gang, and a number of local ladies.
