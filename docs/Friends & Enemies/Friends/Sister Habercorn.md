![[Sister Habercorn.png]]
Grethe Habercorn’s early years did not mark her out for a life as confessor to an ancient noble line of Reikland. A racketeer and gang member, she was well into her adulthood when her faith found her. Sister Habercorn won’t dwell on details of her past, save to smile somewhat ruefully and allude to a misspent youth. She bears the marks of these years still, in her badly scarred, though still functional, eye, and a distinctive tattoo on her face of a knife and teardrop. Despite her generally morose expression, Sister Habercorn is usually affable, though when roused to anger she is fierce indeed.
