Grey Guardian Christoph Engel has called Ubersreik his home for as long as anyone can remember. He is a wiry, unassuming fellow with dark-grey eyes and a neatly trimmed grey beard. On official business, he tends to dress formally, in flowing grey robes, with a pointed, wide-brimmed hat and a staff. However, when seeking to pass incognito, he favours the nondescript clothing of a burgher, the better to blend in and avoid a scene. Engel is often bored with the responsibilities of his rank. He is not above quietly misusing his magic to create minor illusions to trick and disturb citizens for his own amusement.
