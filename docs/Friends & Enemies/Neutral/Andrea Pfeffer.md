Pfeffer’s a no-nonsense woman in her 20s with a distinctive mane of red hair. While she maintains a calm demeanour, the newly appointed Captain is concerned with the disruptions caused by the Altdorfers with whom she arrived. She is keen for the Burgomeister’s position to be consolidated, or a new noble family installed, the better to calm Ubersreik.
