Benedict Gurkenfeld was an actor and playwright of some renown, once a fierce rival of the famous Detlef Sierck. He now runs the Theatre Varieté, booking performers and serving as Master of Ceremonies as required. During most days he can be found strolling around the [[Marktplatz]] observing the busking entertainers, scouting for talent. He has a number of stage-hands and ushers on staff to assist, and directs a company of local amateurs who perform on occasion. He is planning a revival of The Tragedy of Oswald, Detlef Sierck’s play recounting Drachenfel’s demise.
