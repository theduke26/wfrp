![[Dietgar.png]]
The head butler of the Karstadt estate.

Dietgar has a medium build and a round, wrinkled face, with a large nose that gives his stern visage a comical aspect. His short, greying hair is receding rapidly. He never raises his voice, and is always courteous and respectful — even on those occasions when he is regretfully forced to use violence.

He has an ugly scar on his right hand in the shape of a ‘T’, the result of the branding he received, so he always wears gloves to hide it.
