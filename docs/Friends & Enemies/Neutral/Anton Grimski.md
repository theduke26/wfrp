Anton Grimski, a firebrand agitator, has taken to visiting the Sprichstumpf most mornings, railing against the bourgeois corruption of [[NPCs/Ernst Maler]] and the guilds, urging the common folk to rise up against their wealthier compatriots. Grimski is, in truth, in the pay of the Jungfreuds, who wish to show the Burgomeister is unable to maintain order.
