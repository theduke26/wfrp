The Mess and Bucket is an inn that caters almost exclusively to the soldiery of Ubersreik. It has a large common room that is technically open to the public, although civilian patrons will draw disapproving scowls and jeers. The furniture is cheap, given how regularly it is broken in bar fights â€” the arrival of troops from Atdorf has only exacerbated things.

Upstairs, the inn offers a private club, with membership available to officers bearing their letters of commission. Access is via an external staircase, ensuring that officers and their guests need not breathe the same air as the rank and file.

[[Otto Klemp]] is head bouncer.

[[Dietmar Varttiger]] is the head waiter of the First Floor Club

[[Berthold Hanson]] tends bar downstairsm, and is the owner of the establishment.
