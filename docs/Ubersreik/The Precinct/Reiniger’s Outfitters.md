Reiniger’s has been the principal outfitters for Ubersreik’s military forces for decades. A large, two-storey building, it bears an air of genteel charm at odds with its surroundings. The ground floor services rank and file uniforms, with a small office for bursars from the regiments to make their orders, and the bulk of the space used for storage and for a small army of seamstresses.

The first floor is reserved for Officers. Here the gentlemen and ladies of privilege can have their measurements taken, to ensure the perfect fit, uniform regulations playing second fiddle to the latest fashions from Nuln and Altdorf.

[[Florian Reiniger]] is the chief tailor.
