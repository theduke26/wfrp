Though called the Chapel of Ulric, it is actually a temple. It is a large, cold building with an imposing stone façade — resembling a fortress more than a temple. Within, a flame burns day and night, beside a large statue of a grim-faced Ulric.

Denfather [[Holst Kretschmer]], a heavily bearded Middenlander, tends the temple.

In addition to two other priests, Father Reiker and Father Arbert, Kretschmer has a small contingent of Knights of the White Wolf stationed in the temple.
