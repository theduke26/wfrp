This sizeable barracks once billeted Ubersreik 3rd Regiment of Foot, the Reikland 33rd, nicknamed: ‘the Fighting Stags’. The regiment retreated as the State Army of Altdorf  approached, so the building now lies empty. A large wall rings the muster ground where the soldiers once drilled. Against the wall are towers, workshops, barracks, kitchens, refectories, and chapels, most of which are locked and quiet.

Aware the barracks may become a rallying point for Jungfreud sympathies, General von Dabernick ordered the walls patrolled with Altdorf soldiers. At any one time, two squads of eight halberdiers, each led by a sergeant, march around the periphery, thoroughly bored, dreaming of a better detail. When off-duty or resting, the soldiers gather in the north tower to eat, drink, play cards or dice, and chew wierdroot.

Patrol of the barracks is managed be Sergeant [[Rikard Jaekel]]
