The Merchant Quarter extends eastwards from Marktplatz to the base of the Hill. It contains the [[Merchant's Guild]], as well as a number of traders, retailers, and offices, as well as some smaller warehouses. Most of the buildings here are part stone, part timber, and even in these difficult times, several are being extended and redeveloped as trade in [[Ubersreik]] swells. By day, the quarter it is usually busy, filled with burghers of all classes, but at night it grows quieter the further you stray from the Market Square, though it is well-patrolled by the Watch.
