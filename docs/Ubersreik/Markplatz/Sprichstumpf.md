The Sprichstumpf is the stump of a great oak tree that once stood in what is now Market Square. It was felled during Magnus’ reconstruction of the town, and its timbers form the roof of the Nobles’ Court in the Town Hall.

The remaining stump, which is around eight feet wide, stands not far from the statue of Magnus. It has become the focal point for the town’s agitators and pamphleteers, an impromptu pulpit from whence they can rant and extort to the masses.
