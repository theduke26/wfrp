The High Temple of Sigmar, the Empireâ€™s patron god, was the first building rebuilt on the orders of Magnus the Pious after the old one was levelled by Greenskins during the Great War Against Chaos. It is the largest temple in town, dwarfing those in other quarters. The facade is lined with pillars, and the temple itself can hold hundreds of worshippers.

On especially busy Festags (festival days), poorer worshippers huddle outside the doors, straining to hear the service. Recently, locals have found the temple significantly busier, as it is filled with officers and soldiers from Altdorf.

Father [[Gunther Emming]] is the High Priest.
