The Temple of Verena, Goddess of Wisdom, stands at the southeast corner of Handel Square. A modest building, its services are attended regularly by scholars, including members of Ubersreik’s judiciary. Behind the single-storey temple lies the ‘Annexe’, a large library open to all. The Annexe contains a broad, well-lit reading room and many cases of books and scrolls, including the town’s charter and bylaws, and minutes of the Jungfreuds’ historical rulings. The more valuable, or dangerous, books are located in a locked room, only accessible with the high priest’s blessing.
