Ubersreik has only three licensed physicians, keen to emphasize their status and education, and stamp out the epidemic of barber surgeons performing unlicensed back-alley surgery. Each physician has an office and consultation room on the timber-and-lathe first floor, while the stone-walled ground floor contains a shared reception area and waiting room, and a thoroughly sound-proofed operating theatre.
