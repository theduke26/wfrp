![[Wizard's Tower.png]]

Graf Otto Strasse is a long, winding street that snakes through the eastern end of the [[Artisan's Quarter]]. It is known colloquially as Wizard’s Way, as it is home to the town’s only permanent wizard. The street mostly comprises small shops selling herbs, books, and other esoterica, but it is dominated by the Grey Wizard’s tower — a crooked, slate-roofed turret — that peeps above the other stone and timber buildings. Although the tower can be clearly seen, its actual entrance is seemingly impossible to locate. Curious visitors have circumnavigated the tower repeatedly in search of a door or alleyway, but to no avail; locals gave up long ago.
