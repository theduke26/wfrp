In recent years, this guild has grown significantly in wealth and influence. In addition to forks and knives, they have begun selling weaponry. While the bylaws of [[Ubersreik]] specify that only members of the Metalworkersâ€™ Guild may make swords, the cutlers have exploited a loophole regarding how the handle is attached to the tang, allowing them to class their blades as knives (albeit knives with blades several feet long).

The building comprises the old guildhouse, which has been expanded to include a large forge and workshop area, and a small showroom. Here shoppers can purchase blades, which are of high quality and surprisingly good value.
