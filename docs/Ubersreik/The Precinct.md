The Precinct is Ubersreik’s military district, centred around the fortress of [[Magnus’s Tower]]. It was built using some of the foundations of the town from before it was razed. It is separated from the rest of Ubersreik by stout walls. Though the gates are rarely closed, in cases of civil unrest, they can be used to turn the district into a defacto fortress. In simpler times, the State Army, both the Watch and those guarding the walls and surrounding province, were stationed here. At the time, it was arguably the safest part of town. However, since the arrival of the troops from Altdorf, tensions have noticeably escalated. The uncertainty regarding jurisdiction has led to clashes between the local troops and the interlopers, resulting in fighting in the streets. While there have been no deaths as yet, commanding officers fear it is only a matter of time before one side or the other takes things too far.
