The stone facade of this long, low shop is carved with the shapes of traditional masks. The carving is beautifully wrought, making the shop stand out, even compared to the other elegant businesses on Osterstrasse. Madame Beaumarteauâ€™s is the premiere boutique for an array of fine costumes as well as fancy masks and more austere garb.
