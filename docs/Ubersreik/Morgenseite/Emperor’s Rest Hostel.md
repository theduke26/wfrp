The six-storey Emperor’s Rest sits at the base of the Hill by the northern end of the Osterstrasse and provides suites of rooms and fine dining for the wealthiest of Ubersreik. The prohibitive prices, and burly, if well-liveried, guards ensure the riff-raff are kept at bay. Political uncertainty following the change in Ubersreik’s status has led to a drop in business, which concerns the staff.

The fabulously wealthy Duke of Telland owns the impressive hostel. He won the establishment in a high stakes game of Scarlet Empress during Black Powder Week in Nuln. Managing the hostel on his behalf, the scrupulously clean [[Hedrich Hann]], a man of refined manners, careful movements, and sombre moods, monitors his 37 staff of varying positions with a general’s eye and a firm tongue.
