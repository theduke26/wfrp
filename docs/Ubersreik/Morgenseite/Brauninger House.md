Brauninger House Owned by the Brauninger merchant family, this building is modest for The Hill, it contains 16 rooms, a large servants’ quarters, and separate stables and coach house. The Brauningers built the house over two centuries ago. The merchant house has contracts with several noble families and mercenary outfits across eastern and southern Empire to supply arms: the family’s primary business. Many of the town’s forges are under the family’s control, and the Metalworking Guild is a close ally.

Owned by [[Sigmar Brauninger]]
