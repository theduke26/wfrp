The Artisans’ Quarter is the industrial heart of Ubersreik. It lies to the east of the Grey Lady Road, on the north bank of the Teufel, where raw materials and finished goods are loaded and unloaded on wharves. By day the ringing sounds of hammers striking metal blends with the acrid stench of the town’s tanners and chandlers.

The quarter contains several slum districts at the periphery supporting taverns and cheap shops servicing the town’s workers. Even at night the streets are rarely empty as workers relax after a hard day’s graft. Since the Jungfreuds were ousted and their trade embargo began, coal has become scarce. Now the streets are full of apprentices on the scrounge for anything to burn.
