![[Crooked Hammer.png]]
The Crooked Hammer is a slightly seedy, rough-looking tavern typical of those found in the [[Teubr√ºcke]]. It serves a variety of hard spirits and watery ales, at cheap prices. It is an open secret that the drinking house is a front for a gambling den, run by [[The Crosses]], adherents of Ranald, the God of Trickery, who view such activities as holy work. To the rear of the building, they operate a soup kitchen, using the profits of their gambling den to provide basic sustenance to the poor and needy of Ubersreik.

At any given time, gamblers of all walks of life will be found partaking in this particular brand of worship, providing they have ready coin or good credit. The authorities tolerate the gambling, in part because of the charitable work of [[The Crosses]], and in part because so many influential citizens frequent the Hammer.

Most are aware of the gambling den run by [[The Crosses]].
