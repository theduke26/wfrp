The two-storey Red Moon Inn primarily caters to boatmen plying their trade up and down the Teufel. It’s the cleanest of the dock-side hostels, though still somewhat shabby. The lower floor is built from solid stone and includes a large drinking hall, common room, and small kitchen. The upper floor is timber and lathe and contains the inn’s private rooms, and a room for the owner. The main drinking hall has a row of quiet booths all slung with heavy curtains and tattered linen to provide a little privacy.
