A stylized brass cat hangs above the Kat House, a dockside brothel dedicated to Katya, the Goddess of Disarming Beauty. The sizeable four-story building caters to clientele of all races and classes, and is protected by ever-present bouncers. Although most of its staff present as female, all tastes are catered for.
