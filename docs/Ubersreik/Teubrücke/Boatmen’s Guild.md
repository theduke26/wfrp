![[Boatman's Guild.png]]
The Boatmen’s Guild meets in a converted two-storey riverfront warehouse in the southside of the Teufel. The lower floor has a subsidised tavern and dormitory for its members with almost everything sold at cost, and several private rooms also available. The food and drink is decent and plentiful. The upper floor, looking down over the drinking hall, contains the guild’s offices and the guildmaster’s quarters. The guild is affiliated with the Boatmen’s Guilds of [[Auerswald]], [[Kemperbad]], and [[Altdorf]], meaning members of one guild are given all the benefits of all the other guilds, including access to the tavern and dormitories, pensions for widows and orphans, and access to guild contacts.

Robbo Brambledown runs the kitchens, and prides himself on being able to reproduce Dwarf and Elf cuisine, though the Halfling is rarely ever asked to do so.

The guild’s working relationship with [[Altdorf]] has kept them neutral in the town’s political turmoil.
