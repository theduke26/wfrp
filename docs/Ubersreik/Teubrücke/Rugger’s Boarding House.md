Rugger’s is Ubersreik’s cheapest inn, and for good reason: the beds are infested and the common room mouldy and damp. The lower floor has a dirty kitchen, a creaky dining hall, and the common room. The upper floor squeezes four private rooms (each with two double bunks) and the proprietor’s room into a tiny space.
