This unassuming wooden building not far from [[Ubersreik]]’s two dry docks on the southside of the river houses the offices for the combined Guild of Boatbuilders and Chandlers. Thirty years ago, the two guilds, both of which were important to the town but only contained a handful of members each, combined forces to amplify their voices. Today, the guild is still small, but it is also undeniably powerful due to its significant impact to the local economy.

Although called the Guild of Boatbuilders and Chandlers, and although it may employ several shipwrights, the guild doesn’t actually build boats or ships. It builds barges.

The differences may be slight, but to riverfolk, they are very important. In common river-Reik parlance, a barge is any river-borne vessel with a flat bottom, allowing for shallowriver travel and a much greater cargo-carrying capacity. By comparison, boats and ships have deeper keels, which aid ocean and deep-river travel. Ships are also larger, typically with at least three masts.
