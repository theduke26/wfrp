The exterior of the Bretonnian Grail Chapel is unassuming, a modest warehouse, typical of those in the district. Only the innocuous wooden inscriptions of fleur-de-lys along the eaves mark it as anything special. Within the walls, however, the building is sumptuous. Its walls and columns are intricately
carved and beautifully painted, redolent with frescoes depicting legends of the Lady of the Lake, and brave knights of Bretonnian Lore.

The building was used as an internment camp decades ago, during the Fifth Parravon War. The Bretonnian captives decorated the chapel. As a conciliatory gesture (and a long-lasting testament to the beauty and versatility of wooden buildings), the chapel has been maintained by the Carpentersâ€™ Guild ever since.

Ex-pats and visiting Bretonnians often visit, paying their respects to the lady.
