Strohmann Markt lies at the edge of the [[Teubr√ºcke]], where it connects to the fortified Precinct district. A relatively small, open square, it hosts a number of stalls by day, selling a wide variety of food and clothing.

[[Sabina Hocheim]]'s livery and stables dominates one side of the platz, where visitors can stable their horses.
