Grodni Surehammer and his Dwarf Engineers’ Guild designed and built Ubersreik Bridge over 200 years ago. At that time, Ubersreik was little more than a ruin recently retaken by the State Army of Reikland. The newly crowned emperor, Magnus the Pious, was keen to rebuild what was lost, so commissioned his Dwarf allies to construct a new crossing over the Teufel.

A small shanty town, known locally as Dunkelfeucht, has sprung up under the bridge’s shadow. The Jungfreud supporters in Ubersreik turn their noses up at this development, citing it as yet another failing of the interlopers from the north.

Recent rumours suggest the gangs of the Dunkelfeucht are being bound together by a new leader known only as ‘The Baron’.
