Beyond Ubersreik’s broad stone walls, the land lies clear for hundreds of yards, the encroaching trees felled annually lest brigands or worse venture from the dark recesses of the forest. A local bylaw prohibits the erection of stone buildings within bow-shot of the walls, ensuring Ubersreik can be defended properly. An obvious loophole has allowed for wooden buildings to be constructed, though there are not many of these, with only certain buildings tolerated in order to spare the sensibilities of the citizenry. Shanty towns or impromptu marketplaces designed to avoid the town’s taxes are not tolerated. Any make-shift towns will be torn down by the Watch or patrolling soldiers.
