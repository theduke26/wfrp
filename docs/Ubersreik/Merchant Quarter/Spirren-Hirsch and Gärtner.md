Spirren-Hirsch and Gärtner are the foremost practitioners of law in [[Ubersreik]]. The building is notable for its multiple entrances and exits, to allow discretion on the part of their clientele, particularly useful given the firm’s propensity for representing both parties in civil cases.

Wilhelm Gärtner and Melina Spirren-Hirsch are the firm’s chief partners. Spirren-Hirsch is an intelligent, sophisticated woman in her 60s. Gärtner is only 30, with a brash, arrogant streak. Many student lawyers and clerks assist the partners.
