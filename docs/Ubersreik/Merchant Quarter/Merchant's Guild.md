![[Merchant's Guild.png]]
The Merchants’ Guild has become the political powerhouse of [[Ubersreik]] overnight. Following the Jungfreuds’ removal, it is now the most influential force in local politics. Guildmaster [[Marta Müller]] is keen to exploit this influential force for the benefit of the guild and the town’s merchants. It is a mass of wooden scaffolding, swarming with surly tradesmen. There’s a private club for local merchants, or visitors who are signed in by a member in the ground floor. Upstairs there is a suite of more formal meeting rooms.
