![[Rat Catchers.png]]
Until recently, the rat catchers of Ubersreik barely had a guild. They met once a month in the [[Red Moon Inn]] to discuss rodent nests, but otherwise kept to themselves. The duke of Ubersreik funded a rat-tail bounty, which was just generous enough for them to make a living. But then the Jungfreuds were removed from power, and the rat catchers, bountiless, seemed doomed.

However, just a week later, [[Wahlund]], a foreign rat catcher, arrived in Ubersreik with his ‘Exterminators’. Wahlund bought an old inn, which he offered the guild if it let him lead them. Somewhat stunned, the rat catchers warily agreed, and Wahlund became Guildmaster Wahlund.
