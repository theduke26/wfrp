Seven small warehouses are ringfenced to the north of the [[Merchant Quarter]] and well-patrolled by private guards. They are owned by the Unterdaumen Merchant House, an Ubersreik merchant family who trade in whatever is cheap that season, in order to sell it at a profit elsewhere. Each warehouse has large double-doors, is around ten-yards long, and has no windows.
