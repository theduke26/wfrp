![[Potion Shop.png]]
A spacious three-story building, the Potion Shop has large arched windows illuminating the ground floor, where potions are made and sold. The first floor holds the spacious and well-lit private quarters of the owner, [[Siegfried von Holzenauer]]. The staff quarters lie above this, in the cramped attic rooms.
