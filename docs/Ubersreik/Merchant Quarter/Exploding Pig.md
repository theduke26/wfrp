Just off Abrechnungsplatz lies the Exploding Pig, a large tavern frequented by merchants, traders, and, on Marktags, visiting farmers. Its two floors are a hive of gossip, especially among local burghers with an interest in trade and local politics. Since the arrival of the State Soldiers from Altdorf, the Pig is much busier than usual as Ubersreikâ€™s chattering middle classes gather to discuss the latest developments concerning the Town Council and then jockey for influence.
