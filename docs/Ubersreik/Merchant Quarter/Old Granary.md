Dominating the skyline in the south of Ubersreik, the Old Granary is one of the fortress-town’s tallest buildings. The conical construction is entirely built from stone, and has many doors up its north-facing side. It is wrapped with an external staircase that has seen better decades. Despite the name, it is currently the only granary within the town’s walls. Indeed, as flour is extremely flammable and prone to exploding, fire is a constant risk, and many precautions are taken to ensure there is never a problem. Because of this, the Old Granary is heavily guarded, and no naked flames, engineers, or wizards are permitted within ten feet by law.

The Blessed Guild of Lady’s Vale’s Master Millers owns and maintains the Old Granary. The guildhouse is located in a small adjoining building to the granary’s rear. Flour is sold from a small kiosk to the fore of the guildhouse, not from the granary itself. Purchasers receive a clay chitty that can be redeemed at the Old Granary in exchange for the purchased amount of flour. The chitty set is changed daily to make it difficult for counterfeits to be used.
