A modest, stone built building, Sister’s Bakery is tucked in between a leather shop and a milliner. It’s a single storey, noticeably shorter than the other buildings on its street, a fact in which the Halfling owners take great pride. Inside, there is a small area for serving customers, lined with shelves laden with bread and pies, with more delicate confections kept behind the counter.
