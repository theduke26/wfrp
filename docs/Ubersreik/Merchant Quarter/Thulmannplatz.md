A small square, Thulmannplatz is home to Ubersreik’s stocks. In addition to criminals being punished by Magistrates, the Altdorf forces have taken to imprisoning anyone resisting their instructions, or publicly supporting the Jungfreuds. Sometimes these poor unfortunates remain locked up for hours, or even days, before the Watch arrives to release them.

Ever enterprising, a number of Halfling stallholders have begun selling rotting fruit and vegetables to public-spirited Ubersreikers, which they can hurl at wrongdoers.
