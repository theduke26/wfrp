A large, two-storey, stone building, the Corn Exchange used to be the primary market for all grain trading in [[Ubersreik]]. The building has been reconfigured as an indoor market, with numerous small retail stalls present on most days. The ground floor is a maze of stalls selling clothes, food, homewares, and knick-knacks of all kinds.

Numerous traders offer their wares here, including: Ekkehard Eich, trader in rare books; Heinz Giegerich, a scribe who will read or write letters for a fee; and Malasa Nusa, an Arabyan textile merchant. The stallholders all pay rent to scowling Elke Furlisdottir, the Dwarf landlord. Elke’s brother, ‘Mighty’ [[Borin Bozaksson]], is responsible for security throughout the Corn Exchange. Only the fastest or most foolish of thieves consider shoplifting under Borin’s watch, as the girth of his biceps are obvious, and the sharpness of his eyes evident.
