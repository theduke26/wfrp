The Grauer Palast is a squat keep to the north-east of Black Rock Castle. It was long used as the official residence of the Baron of [[Ladyâ€™s Vale]], the heir to the duchy of [[Ubersreik]]. It contains the largest ballroom in the [[Vorbergland]], and is where the Jungfreuds once conducted their social functions and weddings.

The keep now houses Lady [[Emmanuelle Nacht]], the Imperial Herald, and the true power in [[Ubersreik]].
