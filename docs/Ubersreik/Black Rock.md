Black Rock is less a district, and more a castle complex named for the dark granite that forms its ancient walls, and from the Jungfreuds’ ancestral duchy, also called Black Rock, in the Grey Mountains. It dominates [[Ubersreik]], covering almost an eighth of the town. It is ringed by huge parapets connecting directly to the town’s walls, making it integral to [[Ubersreik]]’s defence. A secure tunnel leads from Black Rock to the Magnus Tower, allowing for troops and messages to pass from fortress to fortress, should the town fall. For centuries it was the bastion of the Jungfreuds.

The invading troops from Altdorf made Black Rock their home, tearing down the silver and blue banners of the von Jungfreuds and replacing them with Altdorf ’s red and blue, a gesture of disrespect many locals find galling.

Within Black Rock’s walls lies a bustling community. In many ways, it is a town within a town. The primary keep, [[Black Rock Castle]], is the largest single structure within the complex. Many support buildings are also found there, including grain stores, workshops, museums, chapels, housing, watch-towers, animal pens, orchards, bath houses, muster grounds, gardens, stables, surgeries, kennels, and courts.

When [[Ubersreik]] was seized, any remaining Black Rock staff were forcibly ejected from the castle grounds, with the exception of [[Sister Habercorn]] in [[Saint Arnold's Chapel]] whose holy vows protected her. As many of these workers — including servants, gardeners, artisans, and more — were local, this has led to much resentment among the working classes of [[Ubersreik]], not that most would voice their discontent to the foreign soldiers patrolling their town. Most of the workers’ homes are now taken as billets by troops from Altdorf. Indeed, all five regiments led by [[Jendrick von Dabernick]] to seize [[Ubersreik]] are barracked in Black Rock. Two of these are normally found patrolling the surrounding duchy at any one time, meaning there are rarely more than a thousand Altdorf soldiers in Black Rock at any one time.
