Beneath Dawihafen, a network of sturdy Dwarf-built tunnels forms its own subterranean street network. A large shrine to Grimnir lies at the nexus of the passages — a natural meeting point for local Slayers to gather. The tunnels lead to most major Dwarf locations in [[Ubersreik]], including The [[Axe and Hammer]], [[Harataken Hold]], and the houses of other prominent Dwarf families. The Dwarf tunnels are separate and discrete from both the Human sewers, and the Dwarfs’ own sewer system, which lies deeper underground. The tunnels are regular, well-constructed, and well-lit, not to mention well-patrolled. Should any non-Dwarfs find their way into the network, they will be politely, if forcibly, ejected. Repeat offenders will not be treated gently.
