A large, low-ceilinged building, Nordwander and Son’s prides itself on selling everything its clientele will need to mount expeditions into the Grey Mountains. A one-stop-shop for mountaineering, rock-climbing, and camping outdoors, it carries pitons, ropes, mallets, crampons, picks, chisels, rations, tents, bedrolls, and anything else a party may need before venturing out into the mountainous terrain to [[Ubersreik]]’s south.

The shop initially catered exclusively to Dwarfs, but when word of the quality of their gear, and the fairness of their prices, spread, others soon made their way to [[Dawihafen]]. They now stock clothing and tools that better suit non-Dwarf physiognomies, yet are of the same fine Dwarf manufacture. Despite their broader clientele, the shop is still set up with Dwarfs in mind, with low ceilings and broad aisles.
