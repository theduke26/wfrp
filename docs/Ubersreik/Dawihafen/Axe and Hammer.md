![[Ace and Hammer.png]]
The Axe and Hammer is the only dedicated tavern in [[Dawihafen]], though there are also three inns. The Axe and Hammer has one floor above ground, containing a large common room and a number of smaller booths and meeting rooms. The walls, floors, tables, and chairs are all made of stone, and intricately wrought with images of Dwarf ancestors. The ceilings are low, and the building has no windows, being lit by lamps and a great fire roaring in the centre of the large open space. Although most customers are Dwarfs, all folk are welcome.
