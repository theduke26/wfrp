Morgenseite, known locally as ‘The Hill’, is the most affluent quarter of Ubersreik. The homes of Ubersreik’s wealthier middle-class families form a terrace leading up the Hill to the manors, mansions, and small estates of the wealthiest nobles, guildmasters, and clerics. Curving around the bottom of the Hill, Osterstrasse hosts the town’s elite shops, including high-class couturiers, eateries, jewellers, armourers, and other luxury goods. The Watch patrol Morgenseite enthusiastically. Undesirables and those inappropriately dressed are likely to be moved along with a swift boot.
