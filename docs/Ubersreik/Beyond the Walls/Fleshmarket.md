The Ubersreik fleshmarket lies to the north-east of the town. Given the law against stone, it comprises a handful of wooden buildings, with a number of stakes forming pens alongside pitches for tents and wagons, including a stables and a kennel, which are permanent fixtures. Other beasts (pigs, cattle, sheep, and similar) are driven to the pens on a rotational basis.

[[Juna Sattelrücken]] is Ubersreik’s main horse-coper.
