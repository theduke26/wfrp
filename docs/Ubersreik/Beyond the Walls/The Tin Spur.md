The Tin Spur is a large, open-roofed, circular building near the southern Nuln Gate. It is used for various entertainments, including bear-baiting, dog fights, and pitfighting. It is occasionally used by entertainers to put on plays, both itinerant troupes or local players. The building lies outside the town’s walls, owing to a bylaw put in place a few decades ago, because the sight of blood offended the delicate sensibilities of Lady Jungfreud. There are three floors of galleries for watching the performances. A series of pens lie attached to the rear of the timber and lathe building, where the animals are kept, alongside a meagre collection of costumes and props.

The Esteemed Company of Ubersreik Players own and maintain the building. Chief among them is their playwright, [[Wilhelm Shütteln]], whose works tend to be overlong and wordy.
