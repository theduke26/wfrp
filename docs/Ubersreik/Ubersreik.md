Ubersreik is one of the brightest jewels in the Reikland’s crown. The striking fortress-town’s magnificent bridge is both a spectacular feat of engineering, and an enduring symbol of our alliance with the dwarfs. it connects the threading roads, rivers, and canals to the vast tapestry of trade and commerce in which our empire is wrapped, forming an unrivalled mercantile centre. from a distance, Ubersreik may appear serene, but up close many signs reveal its tumultuous and violent history. 

Ubersreik ’s streets run red with the blood of Reikland. Corpses of good, stout-hearted folk hang from the walls for no crime but obedience to their liege-lords. The Cult of Sigmar demands all honour their noble lords and masters, but the only reward for such loyalty in Ubersreik is a short drop and early passage to Morr’s Realm. None can understand why Altdorf State Soldiers arrived to remove Graf Sigismund von Jung freud from power. The Emperor claimed the old graf was preparing for war with the Duchy of Wallenstein to the north, that he had marshalled soldiers by the thousand in secret and was ready to strike. But few believe such elaborate claims, for the graf was a fair, strong ruler and beloved of the people. So, nobles and commoners alike gossip like fish-wives from the halls of power to the cheapest tavern. What could cause the Emperor to do this?
