[[Ubersreik]] has maintained close ties with the Dwarfs since Magnus the Pious appealed to them for their aid in rebuilding the town following the Great War Against Chaos. In addition to the soaring bridge — a famous landmark hereabouts — the town’s walls and many of its stone buildings are of solid Dwarf construction. Dawihafen, [[Ubersreik]]’s Dwarf Quarter, is a tightly knit community of local Dwarfs. Only a handful of Humans and Halflings inhabit the area; mostly just the town’s 1000 or so Dwarfs gather here. The Dwarf population largely keep to themselves.
